# Resume builder with React, TypeScript and TailwindCss

Jeez this one was kind of annoying mainly because In the beginning I didn't really know what to do for example I thought the best course of action would be to build the resume inputs first... horible mistake I shouldve started with the highest parent... which was the App.tsx file... and then put in some dummy information so that it would show on the resume side... and then pass the information down to the resume input children as states and then they can edit the state but yeah...

Learning Tailwind actually wasnt that hard... it is a lot like css I did have to go to the docs a lot (the docs were probably the best docs I have ever read...) but I learned a lot using the docs and since I have a solid understanding of css it really wasnt that hard...

pretty much the same thing with Typescript... I did learn about React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction> that was cool and React.ChangeEvent other than that it was pretty easy to learn I did use AI a little bit but I learned from what it fixed and understood it fully so I wasnt really cheating persay anyways this project taught me a lot bu was super boring
